-   Finish API Endpoints
-   Install Tailwind
-   Create Frontend Components and Pages

This week we finished most of the work that required mob coding. We began creating our stories along with issues for our project. We decided to go with tailwind to style our website. A lot of focus was put towards pages and components since we are starting to work on our frontend and implement functionality in the UI.

-   Schemas
-   Wireframe
-   Planning

Planning out everything such as the wireframe, schemas, and endpoints prior to coding was very helpful. It allowed us all to be on the same page on what we were building and the functionality we were striving for. It also made the implementation of the code easier because most of the work is already done.

This week we worked together and accomplished a lot of work. We plan on starting to implement our assigned endpoints in fastAPI next week, as well as begin on the frontend. We successfully setup our project with a strong foundation this week so going into next week we can begin fully constructing our vision of the website.

-   Schemas
-   Wireframe
-   Planning

Planning out everything such as the wireframe, schemas, and endpoints prior to coding was very helpful. It allowed us all to be on the same page on what we were building and the functionality we were striving for. It also made the implementation of the code easier because most of the work is already done.

-   Schemas
-   Wireframe
-   Planning

Planning out everything such as the wireframe, schemas, and endpoints prior to coding was very helpful. It allowed us all to be on the same page on what we were building and the functionality we were striving for. It also made the implementation of the code easier because most of the work is already done.

2/19-2/23 We created a share drive to track mod 3. We keep our API endpoints in the share drive as well as a excel doc of the schemas for the project. We planed out our endpoints and added the to a wire frame we created on excalidraw. We created and submitted an MVP form that is also in the share drive. We forked the project in git lab. We got our docker containers up and running.
